# Checkpoint 01
_Introduction_
For this checkpoint, you will implement a few basic functions using the javascript fundamentals covered last week.  There are tests to help you through each problem.  See the instructions below for getting the code, running the tests, and submitting your work.  You will have 1 hour to complete everything.

*Please read all instructions before beginning*

## Up and Running
First, *fork* and *clone* down this repo.  Then, `cd` into the cloned repo.

When it is time to submit, you will commit and push your changes then open a pull request to the original repo.

## Run The Tests
Once you are inside the the cloned repo, open `app.js` in your editor.  Take a moment and read through the empty functions.  Each function has a comment describing what is required for each task.  

Go back to the terminal and run `npm test`.  You will notice that there is 1 *failing* test from the `sum` function.  Once you correctly implement `sum` the test will *pass* and the next failing test will appear.  Keep going until either all the tests pass or time is up.  You can exit the test runner by typing `Ctrl + c`

`npm test` will halt on the first failing test.  (If you'd like to see the output from all the tests, try running `npm run testAll`.)

## Submitting
Once all the tests *pass* or time is up, commit your changes, push your code, and then open a PR to this repo.  

Note: Part of this checkpoint is meant to assess your skills with the git/github workflow so instructor help may be limited for the submission portion.
